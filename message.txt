Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is a method of analyzing, manipulating, and processing signals using digital technology. Through DSP, efficient signal filtering, compression, and transformation can be achieved, with applications spanning communication, audio processing, and image processing. The evolution of DSP has provided powerful tools, enabling precise and flexible operations on signals in the digital domain.
